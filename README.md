# Moving Eyes Project
Set of eyes tracking and following the mouse movements. 

## Intro 
Simple HTML code, all JaveScript, CSS, and HTML was place in one file. Two set of eyes set to move and track the curser with onmousemove function. Most of the coding is prodominantly for styling. 

## How to Use 
Simply move your mouse around

## How to Better the project
You will see in the code I attempted to animate and add an interactive mouth to the set of eyes, however, I was unable to properly center the mouth between the eyes, and upon window size, the mouth would be dislocated and misplace. Will continue to work on this in the future.
